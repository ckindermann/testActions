                                    1. edgeCreation: create edge {edge} 
                                    2. deleting edge {edge}
3. obsoleting edge {edge}  [NO CONSENSUS on how to do this in RDF]
                                    4. node move : move {about} from {old value} to {new value} 

                                    5. node deepeing: deepened {about} from {old value} to {new value}
                                    6. node shallowing: shallow {about} from {old value} to {new value}

        7. predicate change?: changing relationship between {about.subject} and {about.object} from {old value} to {new value} [TODO the class EdgeChange only provides a field for subject] 

                                    8. rename {about} from {old_value} to {new valu}
9. synonym {synonym} becomes new name of {about} and name {name} becomes a synoym

[swap label 'label' for <about> with 'synonym'] <- is this correct?

        [TODO: not quite sure how synonyms are treated: oboInOWL:hasRelatedSynonym, hasNarrowSynonym, hasBroadSynonym, hasExactSynonym - query for all four?] obo:IAO_0000118 ?

10. remove node from subset: remove {about} from {subset}  [there is no field for {about}]
 

 NEXT: SUBSETS

oboInOwl:Subset is used to declare a subset in OWL
oboInOWL:inSubset annotation is used to declare a term as part of a subset

                                    15. deleting {about}

16. obsolete {about} and merge into {has direct replacement}
